# Pymaceutical_Data
In this folder you'll find a folder labeled 'Data' and a file labeled 'pymaceuticals'

In the Data folder you'll find 2 CVS files titled 'Mouse_metadata' and 'Study_results' which data was pulled from 

The pymaceuticals document is a Jupyter Note Book which has my code and summary anaylsis 

For this assigment I leverage the Xpert Learning Tool and pandas.pydata.org for sections: 
  1. Line and Scatter Plots 
  2. Correlation and Regression
  3. Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots
